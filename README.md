# Getting Started

These instruction will let you run Lorenzo il Magnifico on your local machine. 

### Prerequisites 

clone 

```
git clone https://github.com/vladcore/LM34.git
```

Inside `target` folder there will be `LM34Server.jar` and `LM34Client.jar` files.

## Run 

### RMI and Socket
RMI: port 20002
Socket: port 20001

move into `target` directory and launch `LM34Server.jar` (one instance only) and `LM34Client.jar` by double clicking or using the terminal:

### Run Server
```
cd target
java -jar LM34Server.jar
```
### Run Client
```
cd target
java -jar LM34Client.jar

```

After at least 2 players are connected, the server waits for other players for 2 minutes before starting the game. This timeout is configurable in target/classes/configurations/config.json line: 4.
If 4 player connect to the same game room, the game starts immediately.

## CLI
Command line interface is available as user interface in order to play this game in a fashion way.

## GUI

GUI developed in JavaFx is also an option :-).

Players will be ordered by Turn order (the highest will be the first player to move, and under him the second one, then the third and so on) 

Player's name will be showed into GUI's title bar 

Users' personal board will be visible once clicked onto a the name of a player

Hovering an action/tower slot will show the corresponding reward that will be collectable from the player that places his pawn in there  

To place a "family member" (pawn) inside an action slot, double click onto the desidered action slot and different kinds of popup  will be shown based on the availability of the move and the additional actions required to be able to occupy the slot correctly.
